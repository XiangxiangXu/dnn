# Feature Extraction in DNN
This repo contains suppoting demos for [1]. The features learned by DNNs are compared with theoretical results.

1. exp1.py: feature extraction for network with ideal expressive power
2. exp2.py: feature extraction for network with restricted expressive power
3. exp3.py: demo for H-score

Environments: keras 2.3.1

A more detailed illustration and Pytorch implementations can be found in this [![blog](https://img.shields.io/badge/blog-gilearning.github.io-black)](https://gilearning.github.io/) series.
